    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Over the past two weeks, I worked on implementing the sequential versions of the two algorithms. In particular, I followed the pseudocode as described in the papers linked in the proposal. I have done some basic testing with simple test cases to confirm the correctness the code, although I have not run a full dataset on my implementations. I also started thinking about how to parallelize the algorithms while I am working on the sequential versions, and have written up skeleton code for the parallel implementations. </p>
    <p>I have also worked on figuring out how to read the datasets from <a href="http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=datasets.php">here</a> In particular, I plan to use the synthetic datasets,data.slen_10.tlen_1.seq.patlen_6.lit.patlen_8.nitems_5000_spmf.txt and data.slen_8.tlen_1.seq.patlen_4.lit.patlen_8.nitems_5000_spmf.txt, as well as Kosarak (10000) to compare the performance of my implementations. Interestingly, most of the datasets listed on the website only have one item per set - all sequences look like &lt;{a}, {b}, {c}, {e}, {d}&gt;, which is not fully using these two algorithms. I can't seem to find any real life datasets that would fully benefit from using these sequential pattern mining algorithms, although I could spend some more time searching around. </p>
    <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
    <p>I think I'll be on pace to completing my deliverables, but I'm not sure if I'll get to the "nice to haves." Since I will be complete with all my school work other than this project by May 1, I should have a lot of time to focus on my project and complete all the implementations I wish to do. Depending on how quickly I can complete all the implementations, I may look into the "nice to have" goals on the week of the presentations. 
    <p>Plan to Achieve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create parallel implementations on multiple cores that have speedup of at least 4x, in order to have a reasonable mining time on big datasets</li>
        <li>Present results and benchmarks on our parallel implementations' correctness and speed compared to the sequential versions on a few datasets</li>
        <li>Create parallel applications that use the data mining algorithms we have created to see how much speedup we can get for real life applications</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Parallelism Competition</h3>
    <p>I plan to show a graph (or multiple graphs) comparing the sequential versions and parallel versions of the two algorithms running on different datasets. In addition, I think it would also be useful to explain what the algorithms are and maybe demo a simple question detection machine learning model using one of the two algorithms. </p>
    <h3>Concerns</h3>
    <p>One of my biggest concerns is that I am not sure where to find good real life datasets that are standard for testing these sequential pattern mining algorithms. I have read a few papers that refer to some datasets, but I can't seem to find them online anywhere.</p>
    <p>Other than datasets, I think most of the work is just coding and getting my algorithms to work. I can see that there are few different ways of parallelizing, so I may implement all the ways I can think of and compare their speed. </p>
    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>April 11 - 18: Implement the sequential versions of the algorithms and identify parallelism</li> (Completed)
        <li>April 18 - 25: Implement the parallel versions of the algorithms</li> (In Progress)
        <li>April 25 - April 29: Finish implementing the parallel versions of the algorithms and start testing</li>
        <li>April 30 - May 2: Continue testing and work on optimization</li>
        <li>May 3 - 9: Finalize Project Report, update site, upload code to Github; finish analysis on data</li>
    </ul>

SCHEDULE. Produce a schedule for your project. Your schedule should have at least one item to do per week. List what you plan to get done each week from now until the parallelism competition in order to meet your project goals. Keep in mind that due to other classes, you'll have more time to work some weeks than others (work that into the schedule). You will need to re-evaluate your progress at the end of each week and update this schedule accordingly. Note the intermediate checkpoint deadline is April 25th. In your schedule we encourage you to be precise as precise as possible. It's often helpful to work backward in time from your deliverables and goals, writing down all the little things you'll need to do (establish the dependencies!).
