    <h1>15-418 Final Project</h1>
    <h2>Parallellized Sequential Pattern Mining</h2>
    <h4>Anna Tan</h4>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>We are going to implement two algorithms for sequential pattern mining on multi-core CPU platforms. We would like to parallellize two common data mining algorithms, PrefixSpan and the GSP algorithm. We will evaluate the performance between the sequential implementations and the parallel implementations, as well as among the parallel implementations. </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Sequential pattern mining is used to discover statistically relevant patterns in large data sets where the data is assumed to be delivered in sequence. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including consumer behavior discovery, DNA pattern discovery, and natural language categorization.</p>
    <p>A sequence in a sequence database is an ordered list of sets of items - it would look something like &lt;{a, b}, {c}, {a, c, d}&gt;. In this sequence, a sequential pattern can be &lt;{a}, {c}&gt;, &lt;{c}, {c, d}&gt;, or &lt;{a, b}, {c}, {d}&gt;. A sequential pattern mining algorithm takes as input a sequence database and a minimum support threshold (minsup), to output all sequential patterns having a support at least minsup. </p>
    <p>PrefixSpan (<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/914830/">Pei et al.</a>) finds these sequential patterns by looking at the prefixes of each sequence and creating pattern-projected database. It appends elements to these sequential patterns one by one, and recursively call the subroutine. </p>
    <p>The GSP algorithm(<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d420/ea39dc136b9e390d05e964488a65fcf6ad33.pdf">Srikant &amp; Agrawal</a>), on the other hand, generates all possible k-sequences from frequent k-1 sequences by "joining" any two sequences, and then checks how much support each of these sequences has.</p>
    <p>Because these algorithms may all potentially explore a large number of possible subsequence patterns across a large number of sequences, they can benefit significantly from parallelism. Often, these data mining algorithms run for very long time and bottlenecks the training and prediction phases of the actual machine learning algorithm. Since for each sequential pattern and each data point, we are doing roughly the same amount of work, we hope to exploit the data parallelism and model parallelism in these two algorithms. </p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory Limitation: Because the sequence database is typically very large and we are generating large sets as the algorithms run, we may have inefficient memory utilization when running on large datasets. We may want to consider compression techniques to reduce the amount of data we need to read into memory.</li>
        <li>In both algorithms, we need to combine the support from different threads to filter out the correct frequent patterns, and then produce a final list of frequent patterns. Depending on how we distribute the workload across threads, this will require communication across threads and usage of shared memory. </li>
        <li>The algorithms can become computationally heavy if the dataset is large, as generating possible k-sequences and projecting sequences are both done on the dataset. Joining any two sequences can also become a very large task if the number of sequences is large. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For PrefixSpan, there is divergence in that not all sequences are included when creating a projected database based on some prefix sequence. The projected database also vary in size. Therefore, we need to consider balancing the workload. </p>
    <p>For the GSP algorithm, we have less divergence in execution. The locality is high for memory access.</p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>I will be using the two papers I referenced in Background as my main source of starting code. Each paper describes the sequential implementation of the algorithm. These algorithms and their parallel versions will be implemented on Gates machines, and run on lateday clusters. </p>
    <p>In addition, I will be using <a href="http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=datasets.php">this list</a> of sequence datasets to test my algorithms for correctness and performance. This list provides a nice variety of databases in sizes, ranging from 800 sequences to 990 000 sequences. </p>
    <p>I will need to look into compression techniques related to sequential sequence datasets if memory limitation becomes an issue in my implementations. </p>

    <h3>Platform of Choice</h3>
    <p>We will be using C++ as our main programming language, since we want to use OpenMP to parallelize our program. Our code will be run on the latedays cluster.</p>

GOALS AND DELIVERABLES. Describe the deliverables or goals of your project.

This is by far the most important section of the proposal:

Separate your goals into what you PLAN TO ACHIEVE (what you believe you must get done to have a successful project and get the grade you expect) and an extra goal or two that you HOPE TO ACHIEVE if the project goes really well and you get ahead of schedule. It may not be possible to state precise performance goals at this time, but we encourage you be as precise as possible. If you do state a goal, give some justification of why you think you can achieve it. (e.g., I hope to speed up my starter code 10x, because if I did it would run in real-time.)
If applicable, describe the demo you plan to show at the parallelism computation (will it be an interactive demo? will you show an output of the program that is really neat? will you show speedup graphs?). Specifically, what will you show us that will demonstrate you did a good job?
If your project is an analysis project, what are you hoping to learn about the workload or system being studied? What question(s) do you plan to answer in your analysis?
Systems project proposals should describe what the system will be capable of and what performance is hoped to be achieved.
IN GENERAL: Imagine that I didn't give you a grading script on assignments 2, 3, or 4. Imagine you did the entire assignment, made it as fast as you could, and then turned it in. You wouldn't have any idea if you'd done a good job!!! That's the situation you are in for the final project. And that's the situation I'm in when grading your final project. As part of your project plan, and ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU SHOULD DO WHEN YOU GET STARTED WORKING is implement the test harnesses and/or baseline "reference" implementations for your project. Then, for the rest of your project you always have the ability to run your optimized code and obtain a comparison.
PLATFORM CHOICE. Describe why the platform (computer and/or language) you have chosen is a good one for your needs. Why does it make sense to use this parallel system for the workload you have chosen?

SCHEDULE. Produce a schedule for your project. Your schedule should have at least one item to do per week. List what you plan to get done each week from now until the parallelism competition in order to meet your project goals. Keep in mind that due to other classes, you'll have more time to work some weeks than others (work that into the schedule). You will need to re-evaluate your progress at the end of each week and update this schedule accordingly. Note the intermediate checkpoint deadline is April 25th. In your schedule we encourage you to be precise as precise as possible. It's often helpful to work backward in time from your deliverables and goals, writing down all the little things you'll need to do (establish the dependencies!).
